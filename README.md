# Web-Programming
A repository for all of my Web Programming assignments.

# Lab1

Has 2 parts:
- a HTML4 only app
- a HTML5 only app


# Lab2

I added CSS to the HTML5 file presented in Lab1.


# Lab3

I added JavaScript to the site.


# Lab4

In this assignment I remade some of the code from the previous assignment by changing some of the code into jQuery.


# Lab5-6

In the final lab I added AJAX and PHP to the site. Everything was developed with help of XAMP.
